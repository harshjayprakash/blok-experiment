# The Blok Experiement

> A project to explore how native Windows applications are created using the WIN32 API.

_Caution: This application may have potential memory leaks. By choosing to compile and run this application, you are aware of this fact._

_This application works through wine._

When launching the application, a black painted window is created with a pink block at the top left corner. Towards the bottom left, there is text showing the X and Y coordinates of the pink square; in addition to whether the block is in a marked location.

The pink block's location can be changed or manipulated through the use of arrow keys from the keyboard, also updating the coordinates at the bottom.

The mouse pointer can be used to mark points on the grid; this is indicated by a white block. It can be unmarked by clicking in the same area.
