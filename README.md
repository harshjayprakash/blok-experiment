# The Blok Experiement

This is a small scale experiment that I have worked on using the WIN32 API. The appication is build for Windows Only.

This application is a pink block that can be moved around using the arrow keys. Where the coordinates of the block is displayed in the bottom left of the window as well as if it is on a marked location.

To mark a location, you simply click on area you want marked, as this is made from a grid.

Clicking on the same location will remove the mark in the grid.
